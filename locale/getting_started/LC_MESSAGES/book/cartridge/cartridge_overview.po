msgid "About Tarantool Cartridge"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Tarantool Cartridge is the recommended alternative to the :ref:`old-"
"school practices <app_server-creating_app>` of application development "
"for Tarantool."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As a software development kit (SDK), Tarantool Cartridge provides you "
"with utilities and :ref:`templates <cartridge-templates>` to help:"
msgstr ""

msgid "easily set up a development environment for your applications;"
msgstr ""

msgid "plug the necessary Lua modules."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The resulting package can be installed and started on one or multiple "
"servers as one or multiple instantiated services -- independent or "
"organized into a **cluster**."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A Tarantool cluster is a collection of Tarantool instances acting in "
"concert. While a single Tarantool instance can leverage the performance "
"of a single server and is vulnerable to failure, the cluster spans "
"multiple servers, utilizes their cumulative CPU power, and is fault-"
"tolerant."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To fully utilize the capabilities of a Tarantool cluster, you need to "
"develop applications keeping in mind they are to run in a cluster "
"environment."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Further on, Tarantool Cartridge provides your cluster-aware applications "
"with the following benefits:"
msgstr ""

msgid "horizontal scalability and load balancing via built-in automatic sharding;"
msgstr ""

msgid "asynchronous replication;"
msgstr ""

msgid "automatic failover;"
msgstr ""

msgid "centralized cluster control via GUI or API;"
msgstr ""

msgid "automatic configuration synchronization;"
msgstr ""

msgid "instance functionality segregation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A Tarantool Cartridge cluster can segregate functionality between "
"instances via built-in and custom (user-defined) :ref:`cluster roles "
"<cartridge-roles>`. You can toggle instances on and off on the fly during"
" cluster operation. This allows you to put different types of workloads "
"(e.g., compute- and transaction-intensive ones) on different physical "
"servers with dedicated hardware."
