msgid ""
"In `disabled` mode the leader is the first server configured in "
"``topology.replicsets[].master``  array."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In  ``eventual``  mode the leader isn't elected consistently. Instead, "
"every instance in cluster thinks the leader is the first **healthy** "
"server in replicaset, while instance health is determined according to "
"membership status (the SWIM protocol)."

msgid "This module behavior depends on the instance state."

"From the very beginig it reports `is_rw() == false`, ``is_leader() == "
"false`` ,  ``get_active_leaders() == {}`` ."

"state for the first time. From that moment it reports actual values "
"according to the mode set in clusterwide config."
