"While an archive may contain many files, the archive itself is a single "
"ordinary file. Physically, an archive consists of a series of file "
"entries terminated by an end-of-archive entry, which consists of two 512 "
"blocks of zero bytes. A file entry usually describes one of the files in "
"the archive (an archive member), and consists of a file header and the "
"contents of the file. File headers contain file names and statistics, "
"checksum information which tar uses to detect file corruption, and "
"information about file types."

"All characters in header blocks are represented by using 8-bit characters"
" in the local variant of ASCII. Each field within the structure is "
"contiguous; that is, there is no padding used within the structure. Each "
"character on the archive medium is stored contiguously. Bytes "
"representing the contents of files (after the header block of each file) "
"are not translated in any way and are not constrained to represent "
"characters in any character set. The tar format does not distinguish text"
" files from binary files, and no translation of file contents is "
"performed."
